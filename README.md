Robust Anomaly Detection in Videos using Multilevel Representations

This project proposed a anomaly detection framework using multilevel information to identify anomaly objects in surveillance videos. Our research results in re-annotating UCSD Ped 1 dataset (http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/anomaly/dataset.htm) which is one of the most widely-used datasets in Video Anomaly Detection. You can find the new label set in the "relabeled_ped1" folder.
